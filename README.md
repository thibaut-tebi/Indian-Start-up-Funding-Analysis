This This repositiory seeks presents an analysis of funding received by Indian startups from 2018 to 2021 using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The objective of this analysis was to gain insights into the Indian startup ecosystem, provide valuable information for decision-makers considering entry into the market, and understand the funding and growth patterns of newly launched startups. The analysis was performed using the Python programming language and popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. These libraries facilitated various analysis tasks, including examining individual variables, exploring relationships between variables, analyzing correlations, and handling duplicate and missing data. 
The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which allowed for an interactive and organized workflow. The notebook provided a seamless platform to execute code, visualize data, and document the analysis process.Standard EDA procedures were followed, including assessing data quality, performing descriptive statistics, and creating visualizations. 

The dataset was explored to understand its structure, check for missing or duplicated data, and convert variables to appropriate formats when necessary. Descriptive statistics provided a summary of the data, allowing for an understanding of the central tendencies, variations, and distributions of the funding received by Indian startups. Visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, were created to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.The analysis also involved examining the relationship between funding and the growth of startups, enabling the identification of potential factors influencing success and providing insights for decision-making.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a vital role in understanding and extracting insights from datasets. It allows us to uncover patterns, relationships, and key characteristics of the data. The main objective of this project is to utilize the CRISP-DM framework as a guiding framework for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting valuable insights. The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that serves as the base for data processing. CRISP-DM involves stages that enable a systematic and structured approach to the analysis process
